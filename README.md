This is Zoou, a social media platform for pet owners. It allows users to make and comment on posts, create profiles for pets, message other users, and utilize a map based searching tool similar to Yelpâ€™s search tool to find pet-focused businesses near them.

It is a continuation of the capstone project from San Francisco State University's CSC648 Software Engineering Course.

Built with React, NodeJS, MySQL, AWS Lambda and S3, and the Google Maps API.
